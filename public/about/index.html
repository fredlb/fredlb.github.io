			<p>I&rsquo;m Fredrik, I like to make things. I have a dog, her name is Maggan, she occupies most of my free time ;)</p>
<p>For the past 8 years I&rsquo;ve worked as a software engineer at Epidemic Sound, working with pretty much everything at one point or another. We were 6 engineers when I started and today we are +100. I&rsquo;ve held different positions over the years such as Tech Lead and Platform Lead for epidemicsound.com</p>
<p>Today I spend my time in the &ldquo;Client Infrastructure&rdquo; team which sits between the SRE team and the product teams working on projects that require deep technical knowledge of our platforms and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some of the things I worked on, from most recent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated a new CDN provider along with adjustments to our web client to bring down TTFB (time-to-first-byte) greatly across the globe.</li>
<li>Migrated all our users to a new authentication system including the integration for epidemicsound.com</li>
<li>Migrated our most critical infrastructure from AWS to GCP, including moving to Kubernetes and on-line data migration.</li>
<li>Migrated all our reoccurring billing to a new provider.</li>
<li>Built support for B2B on our reoccurring billing products.</li>
<li>Architected and built our application architecture for the React web apps, including a custom system that allowed us to do a gradual migration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides working on these projects, I&rsquo;ve been working with most of the product focused work as well. And of-course, all of the major incidents over the years  :)</p>
