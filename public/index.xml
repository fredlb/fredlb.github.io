      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Fredrik, I like to make things. I have a dog, her name is Maggan, she occupies most of my free time ;)
For the past 8 years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a software engineer at Epidemic Sound, working with pretty much everything at one point or another. We were 6 engineers when I started and today we are +100. I&amp;rsquo;ve held different positions over the years such as Tech Lead and Platform Lead for epidemicsound.</description>
